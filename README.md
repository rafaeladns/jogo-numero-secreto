  <h1>Secret Number Game</h1>
  <h2>Project Description</h2>
  <p>The Secret Number Game is a simple guessing game where the player has to guess a randomly generated secret number. The player receives hints to assist in their guessing attempt, such as whether the number is greater or less than the current guess.</p>
